Image Classification using Deep Neural Network
Developed a model utilizing a selected dataset and neural network architecture to train the model across various epochs.
Conducted thorough testing on the trained model to accurately classify a diverse range of images, including but not limited to dogs and cats, while meticulously evaluating its performance.
Implemented a Python-based application to deploy the trained model, enabling it to classify various unlabeled images containing different subjects.
